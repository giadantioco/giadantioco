I'm Giada, and I am  a passionate code learner! <br/>
This magic jorney begun last year when, for joke, I started learning some HTML and CSS. I joined a two months course last November for frontend development. It has been an intensive course that helped me understanding what programming really is about. Guess what happened as soon as I realised there is much more about coding? A part from risking a mental breakdown, I just felt in love and dove into programming! I am currently learning Javascript, and I have just wrote my first widget app. I have also decided to take my learning further and enroll a fulltime bootcamp focused on frontend developement, which will start in May. 
I can't wait to begin this new adventure!
